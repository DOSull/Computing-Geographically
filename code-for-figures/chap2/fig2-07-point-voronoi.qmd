This is most conveniently made using `spatstat`, but I've shown it here making a point pattern into an `sf` dataset and then using `sf::st_voronoi()`. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results=FALSE}
library(spatstat)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

There are a few steps making a `spatstat` point pattern into a simple features dataset...

```{r warning=FALSE}
pp <- rpoispp(100) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 2193)
```

And there are a few more making a point dataset into a Voronoi polygon dataset.

```{r warning=FALSE}
pp_vor <- pp %>%
  st_union() %>%
  st_voronoi() %>%
  st_cast() %>%
  st_as_sf(crs = st_crs(pp))
```

And finally a map.

```{r warning=FALSE}
tm_shape(pp_vor, 
         bbox = pp %>% st_union() %>% st_buffer(0.05)) + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(pp) + 
  tm_bubbles(col = "white", alpha = 0, border.col = "black", size = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(frame = FALSE)
```
