    "section": "Make a map",
    "text": "Make a map\nOK, with that done, we can make a map. The degree of difficulty is much increased by choosing a Briesemeister projection. We choose projections like this one not because they are easy, but because they are hard (something like that…). Anyway the published map is actually an oblique Hammer-Aitoff projection, and not the right kind of oblique projection to be a Briesemeister…\nRecently, I unearthed a proj string at Michael Minn’s website, in the R code for this page that produces the Briesemeister projection. (However… I suspect that code is no longer entirely valid as the +M parameter included in that string no longer seems to have any effect on the output and the linked proj manual is v4.3, which is a long way out of date.)\nAnyway, here’s the string we are using—but even this is not the full story as we will see later.\n\n\nCode\nbries &lt;- \"+proj=ob_tran +o_proj=hammer +o_lon_p=0 +o_lat_p=45 +lon_0=10\"\n\n\n\nDealing with that weird projection\nA world ‘disc’ for the background. Make this by buffering a point and stretching it to an ellipse with the Hammer projection extent.\n\n\nCode\ndisc &lt;- st_point(c(0, 0)) %&gt;%\n  st_buffer(1, nQuadSegs = 90)\ndisc &lt;- disc * matrix(c(18040096, 0, 0, 9020048), 2, 2)\ndisc &lt;- disc %&gt;%\n  st_sfc() %&gt;%\n  st_sf(crs = bries)\n\n\nThe world countries must be cut at the Briesemeister ‘cut line’ which is where there is a break in the projection, to avoid anomalies when places are projected that cross the line. We figured out where this line is in other work…\n\n\nCode\ndata(\"World\")\n\ncut_line &lt;- st_read(\"briesemeister-cut-corrected.geojson\") %&gt;%\n  st_buffer(1000) # metres!\n\nworld &lt;- World %&gt;%\n  st_difference(cut_line) %&gt;%\n  st_transform(bries)\n\n\n\n\nMake a graticule\nA graticule - here we assemble this as linestrings (with many points) because projection of tm_graticules output can be problematic, especially if the projection has cuts other than at ±180° longitude (and even then it can have issues), or as in this case is in any way unusual.\n\n\nCode\nget_meridian &lt;- function(longitude) {\n  st_linestring(matrix(cbind(longitude, seq(-90, 90, 1)),\n                       ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n    st_sfc(crs = 4326)\n}\n\nget_meridians &lt;- function(spacing = 10) {\n  g &lt;- c()\n  for (lon in seq(-180, 180 - spacing, spacing)) {\n    g &lt;- c(g, get_meridian(longitude = lon))\n  }\n  g\n}\n\nget_parallel &lt;- function(latitude) {\n  st_linestring(matrix(cbind(seq(-180, 180, 1), latitude),\n                       ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n    st_sfc(crs = 4326)\n}\n\nget_parallels &lt;- function(spacing = 10) {\n  g &lt;- c()\n  for (lat in seq(-90 + spacing, 90 - spacing, spacing)) {\n    g &lt;- c(g, get_parallel(latitude = lat))\n  }\n  g\n}\n\ngraticule &lt;- c(get_meridians(), get_parallels()) %&gt;%\n  st_sfc(crs = 4326) %&gt;%\n  # again it must be cut at the Briesemeister breakline\n  st_difference(cut_line) %&gt;%\n  st_sfc() %&gt;%\n  st_sf() %&gt;%\n  st_transform(bries)\n\n\n\n\nAs it turns out\nAs noted, the published map is differently projected that the one we are making here. To get to the Briesemeister proper we have to stretch our oblique Hammer-Aitoff projection. See\n\nBriesemeister W. 1953. A new oblique equal-area projection. Geographical Review 43(2) 260–261. doi: 10.2307/211940.\n\nfor details. So let’s also do that here (this really is bonus material). We could use the +proj=affine transformation with appropriate settings, but I’ve had issues getting GDAL and tmap to cooperate with pipeline projected data. Instead, we’ll just use the weird matrix post-multiplication of geometries trick that sf allows to apply the required stretch. Unfortunately this does not update the CRS information, making these data layers useless for almost any other purpose.\n\n\nCode\nstretch_mat &lt;- matrix(c(sqrt(7/8), 0, 0, sqrt(8/7)), 2, 2)\ndisc &lt;- disc %&gt;%\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\nworld &lt;- world %&gt;%\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\ngraticule &lt;- graticule %&gt;%\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\n\n# and not forgetting the Springfields...\nspringfields &lt;- st_read(\"all-results-Springfield.geojson\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(bries) %&gt;%\n  mutate(geometry = geometry * stretch_mat)\n\n\nFor what it’s worth, all these shenanigans are a good example of why more flexibility in the projection architectures of contemporary platforms would be welcome, something discussed in Chapter 3."

We also reorder by the sum of the two variables (in effect from lower-left to upper-right), and number the observations on that basis. This allows us to aggregate observations that are broadly similar or broadly different.\n\n\nCode\nget_correlated_df &lt;- function(cor = 0.5) {\n  # generate a multivariate normal distribution\n  # mu is the mean centre, Sigma is the covariance matrix\n  mvrnorm(n = 1024, mu = c(5, 5), \n          Sigma = matrix(c(1, cor, cor, 1), 2, 2)) %&gt;%\n    as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n    rename(x = V1, y = V2) %&gt;%\n    arrange(x + y) %&gt;% \n    mutate(id = row_number())\n}\n\n\n\n\nAggregator functions\nNext two functions that aggregate either similar or different observations. This is a fairly crude approach but it works. agg_similar() uses integer division to create a ‘grouper’ variable that goes eight 0s, then eight 1s, then eight 2s, and so on up to eight 127s. When group_by is applied using this variable, sets of 8 similar observations are aggregated and the mean taken to give a new dataset.\nConversely, if the grouper variable is based on the remainder from division by 128, we get 8 sequences of 0, 1, 2, 3,… 127, and when these are aggregated into groups, each will consist of eight observations at widely separated positions in the sequence (i.e., with very different values).\n\n\nCode\n# aggregate similar observations\nagg_similar &lt;- function(df) {\n  df %&gt;%\n    mutate(grouper = id %/% 8) %&gt;%\n    group_by(grouper) %&gt;%\n    summarise(x = mean(x), \n              y = mean(y)) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(-grouper) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n}\n\n# aggregate different observations\nagg_different &lt;- function(df) {\n  df %&gt;%\n    mutate(grouper = id %% 128) %&gt;%\n    group_by(grouper) %&gt;%\n    summarise(x = mean(x), \n              y = mean(y)) %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(-grouper) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n}"

The code for making geometries in R is ugly, so I’ve hidden it.\n\n\nCode\nmake_square &lt;- function(x = 0, y = 0, d = 1) {\n  xs &lt;- x + c(-1, 1, 1, -1) * d / 2\n  ys &lt;- y + c(-1, -1, 1, 1) * d / 2\n  xs &lt;- c(xs, xs[1])\n  ys &lt;- c(ys, ys[1])\n  st_polygon(list(matrix(c(xs, ys), ncol = 2)))\n}\n\ngrid &lt;- expand.grid(1:10, 1:10)\n\npolys &lt;- list()\nfor (r in 1:nrow(grid)) {\n  polys &lt;- c(polys, make_square(x = grid[r, 1], y = grid[r, 2]))\n}\n\npoly_sf &lt;- polys %&gt;% \n  lapply(list) %&gt;%\n  lapply(st_polygon) %&gt;%\n  st_sfc() %&gt;%\n  st_sf(x = grid[, 1], y = grid[, 2])\nn &lt;- dim(poly_sf)[1]\npoly_sf$val &lt;- poly_sf$x + runif(n, -0.5, 0.5)\n\n\nAnyway… we have a 10 by 10 grid of squares with values that increase from left to right:\n\n\nCode\nbrks &lt;- .5 + (0:100) / 10\n\ntm_shape(poly_sf) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"val\", palette = \"Spectral\", breaks = brks, lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.show = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we aggregate into columns and rows, taking the mean value of our variable in each case.\n\n\nCode\ncolumn_sf &lt;- poly_sf %&gt;%\n  group_by(x) %&gt;%\n  summarise(val = mean(val)) \n\nrows_sf &lt;- poly_sf %&gt;%\n  group_by(y) %&gt;%\n  summarise(val = mean(val))\n\n\nAnd now we can make maps of the results.
