A quadtree for global information storage. _Geographical Analysis_ **18**(4) 360–371. doi: [10.1111/j.1538-4632.1986.tb00108.x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1986.tb00108.x).\n\nGiven the upset that accompanied the Gall-Peters projection, another 'odd-looking' equal-area projection (only 'odd' because people are so accustomed to Mercator), it's not clear it would catch on! See this paper for a discussion of that controversy:\n\n> Crampton, J. 1994. Cartography’s defining moment: the Peters projection controversy, 1974–1990. _Cartographica_ **31**(4) 16–32. doi: [10.3138/1821-6811-L372-345P](https://dx.doi.org/10.3138/1821-6811-L372-345P).\n\nIn any case, this is simply a standard cylindrical equal-area projection with standard parallels chosen to make the whole map area square. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='fig3-09-tobler-chen_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_f25de45eb10a23a611070b50f2608be8'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(tmaptools)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUse the supplied `World` dataset (in lat-lon EPSG 4326) and project as required!\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='fig3-09-tobler-chen_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_379be6e65d8301b7f03dbeb2a71eb592'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(\"World\") \nworld_tc <- World %>%\n  select(geometry) %>%\n  st_transform(\"+proj=cea lat_ts=55.654\")\n\ntm_shape(world_tc, bbox = bb(xlim = c(-180, 180),\n                             ylim = c(-90, 90))) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"#aaeecc\") +\n  tm_graticules(x = seq(-180, 180, 15), y = seq(-90, 90, 15),\n                labels.show = FALSE, lwd = 0.5) +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = 0, bg.color = \"#ddeeff\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](fig3-09-tobler-chen_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='fig3-09-tobler-chen_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_ea61ae2c0c92d36c33b97d5ef5158fe9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# License (MIT)\n#\n# Copyright (c) 2023 David O'Sullivan\n#\n# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\n# obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\n# files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\n# including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\n# publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\n# and to  permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\n# subject to the following conditions:\n#\n# The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\n# in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n#\n# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\n# OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n# FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
