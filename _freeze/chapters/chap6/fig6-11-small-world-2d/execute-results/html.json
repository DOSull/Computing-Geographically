This particular network structure is less studied than might be expected, and can be considered a very simplified model for how even a small number of more rapid connections between places in a transportation network can dramatically alter its overall characteristics. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='fig6-11-small-world-2d_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_4d4d7622376124f8d41dca9c3eb6196a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='fig6-11-small-world-2d_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_1a806d86a78bb2bc7db5be6a1cac9285'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_graph <- function(G, main = \"\", layout = layout.grid(G), \n                       vertex.color = \"black\") {\n  plot(G, main = main,\n       layout = layout, \n       vertex.label = NA, vertex.color = vertex.color, vertex.size = 5, \n       vertex.shape = \"circle\", vertex.lwd = 0, \n       edge.color = \"black\", edge.width = 0.5)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Sample rewired 2D lattices\nIt's somewhat useful to see what a range of rewired lattices look like.
