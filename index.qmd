# Web resources for _Computing Geographically_
This page keeps up to date links to web resources associated with the book [_Computing Geographically: Bridging Giscience and Geography_ (Guilford Press, New York)](https://www.guilford.com/books/Computing-Geographically/David-O'Sullivan/9781462553938).

Most of these are URLs in footnotes, which may change over time, so that the links become broken. I will try to keep them current here. They are listed by chapter under the **Links** dropdown menu.
