Some of these might be more easily considered when you have read the whole book, or at least a bit more of it than the first chapter. See also the [overall questions page](../../other-stuff/questions-for-discussion.qmd).

<hr>

**Is the premise of the book correct?**

In other words: are geography and giscience really as estranged as I suggest?

<hr>

**What about critical GIS? Isn't it already doing this work?**

Am I too harsh in my assessment of the limitations of critical GIS?

<hr>

The big question (at least for me):

**How have giscience and geography come to be so separate?**

I mention in the preamble (page 2) that 

> I originally planned for this opening chapter to be a historical account of the relationship between giscience and geography. It would open on a couple of my intellectual heroes from early in geographyâ€™s quantitative revolution, showing how their work was deeply engaged with geography, and contrast that with how distanced from geography giscience and GIS have become. Then, somehow or other I was going to explain how this distance had grown. 

What happened? Do any of the capsule explanations that follow this quote seem more plausible than the others? I *know*, this is an unfair question: I ducked answering it completely. But that just makes it all the more worth thinking about.

<hr>

And finally, a silly question:

**Who were those two intellectual heroes I chickened out of writing up?!**

No clues.
