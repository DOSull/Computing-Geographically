If [space](../chap2/index.qmd) and [place](../chap4/index.qmd) are geography's in-house terrible twins then _time_ is its estranged first cousin. The notion of a space-time-attribute hyperspace wherein geography examines fixed time slices, while history focuses on fixed localities over time is firmly embedded in giscience given its origins in automated cartography and the snapshot view of the world implicit in maps. _Time geography_ offers a possible escape from this impasse, and is central to both _human dynamics_ and _mobilities_ perspectives, although those two subfields of contemporary geography remain frustratingly distant from one another.
