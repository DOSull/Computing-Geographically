The original announcement of geohash is in this blogpost by Greg Niemeyer: [blog.labix.org/2008/02/26/geohashorg-is-public](https://blog.labix.org/2008/02/26/geohashorg-is-public). You can generate geohash codes at the website [http://geohash.org](http://geohash.org) (yes `http`, not `https`).

_The Wire_ opens with a comment on place, albeit a very big place: America, which is more of an idea than a place. Inevitably, [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYgKmOJT_gM) will break quickly, but it's worth your time. 

### Figure 4.2
The Bostonography neighborhoods web map is unfortunately no longer working (worth a try, but likely won't work: [bostonography.com/hoods](https://bostonography.com/hoods/)).
