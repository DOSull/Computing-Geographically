Giscience has questions...

<hr>

**What are the possibilities and limitations of a system of addressing like what3words?^[Not including providing cute just-so solutions to puzzles in comedy dramas. See [this clip from _The Outlaws_ S3 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6HLjNsdWLo)]**

What might be the pros and cons of the non-hierarchical nature of what3words addressing scheme?

**Think about the neighbourhood you live in. Where does it begin and end?** 

How do you know when you've arrived 'home'?
