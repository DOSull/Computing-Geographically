Although it is labelled 'point patterns in absolute space', the real (ahem) _point_ of this figure is that spatial analysis often works, in effect, with a relative concept of space, since it is based on notions as here, such as the distances between points.

If you want point patterns, you need [the fantastic `spatstat`](https://github.com/spatstat) by Adrian Baddeley, Ege Rubak, and Rolf Turner.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(spatstat)
```

Make a couple of point patterns, one evenly-space using _sequential spatial inhibition_, and one clustered using a _Thomas process_. For the latter, see

> Thomas M. 1949. A generalisation of Poisson's binomial limit for use in ecology. _Biometrika_ **36**, 18â€“25.

```{r}
pp1 <- rSSI(0.07, n = 105)
pp2 <- rThomas(10, 0.03, 10)
```

Calculate nearest neighbour distances.

```{r}
nn1 <- nndist(pp1)
nn2 <- nndist(pp2)
breaks <- seq(0, max(nn2), length.out = 10)
```

And plot them.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mai = rep(0.3, 4))

plot(pp1, main = "")
hist(nn1, main = "", xlab = "Distance", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = breaks)
plot(pp2, main = "")
hist(nn2, main = "", xlab = "Distance", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = breaks)
```
