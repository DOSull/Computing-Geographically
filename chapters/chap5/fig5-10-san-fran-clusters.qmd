This page produces a coloured version of Figure 5.10 which is easier to read (but may not show the same clusters).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(stringr)
library(HatchedPolygons)
```

## Data
The data are as used in [Luc Guillemot's website example](http://lucguillemot.github.io/bayareageodemo/).

```{r results=FALSE}
sf_demog <- st_read("sf_clustering_data.gpkg")
```

### Data cleanup
There are some NA data which we will show as hatched areas so some work is required on that, and to prepare the hatched polygons using the `hatched.SpatialPolygons` function from the [`HatchedPolygons` package](https://statnmap.github.io/HatchedPolygons/).

```{r}
nas <- sf_demog %>%
  st_union() %>%
  st_difference(sf_demog %>% drop_na() %>% st_union()) %>%
  as("Spatial") %>%
  hatched.SpatialPolygons(density = 0.0035, angle = 45) %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_set_crs(st_crs(sf_demog))

all_areas <- sf_demog %>%
  st_union()
```

## Run the clustering
_k_-means clustering in _R_ using the base `kmeans` function is straightforward, but requires a non-spatial version of the dataset. We also remove the ID columns and the `cluster` assignment from the data (since we don't want to do clustering and include a variable that already designates a cluster).

```{r}
sf_demog <- sf_demog %>%
  drop_na()

sf_demog.d <- sf_demog %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  select(-(1:2), -cluster)

km <- kmeans(sf_demog.d, centers = 9)
```

Next we append the cluster result to the original spatial dataset so we can map it.

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
sf_demog$k9 <- km$cluster %>% as.factor()

tm_shape(all_areas, bbox = bb(xlim = c(1.82e6, 1.87e6), 
                              ylim = c(6.3e5, 6.6e5))) + 
  tm_fill(col = "white") +
  tm_shape(nas) +
  tm_lines(col = "black", lwd = 0.5) + 
  tm_shape(sf_demog) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "k9", style = "cat", palette = "Set2",
              border.col = "white", lwd = 0.35) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE, bg.color = "#ddeeff")
```

And for comparison, below is the regionalization from Luc Guillemot's more complex clustering method. The colours don't match up (they are just colours!) but you can see that the overall regionalisation result is broadly similar, even though we have requested only 9 clusters from the _k_-means analysis.

```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
#| code-fold: true
tm_shape(all_areas, bbox = bb(xlim = c(1.82e6, 1.87e6), 
                              ylim = c(6.3e5, 6.6e5))) + 
  tm_fill(col = "white") +
  tm_shape(nas) +
  tm_lines(col = "black", lwd = 0.5) + 
  tm_shape(sf_demog) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "cluster", style = "cat", palette = "Set2",
              border.col = "white", lwd = 0.35) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE, bg.color = "#ddeeff")
```
