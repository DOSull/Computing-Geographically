I know it sounds a bit daft, but I don't know if I would have finished writing this book if it were not for Rosa Luxemburg-Parks, pictured below. Ever-present in the room I was writing in, she insisted on me getting to my desk at a sensible time every morning, and then just hung out, mostly dozing, and _not_ clambering all over the keyboard or doing any of those other cats-on-the-internet things.

That's all.
