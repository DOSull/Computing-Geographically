### Footnote 9
Lewis Carroll's _Sylvie and Bruno Concluded_ is out of copyright and freely available. See for example, this [ebook](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/lewis-carroll/sylvie-and-bruno) (the one-to-one map appears in Chapter XI). Unfortunately Borges's and Eco's more recent examples are not freely available.
