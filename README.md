# Resources for _Computing Geographically_
This repository contains copies of or links to web resources associated with my book [_Computing Geographically: Bridging Giscience and Geography_ (Guilford Press, New York)](https://www.guilford.com/books/Computing-Geographically/David-O'Sullivan/9781462553938).

Most of these resources are URLs in footnotes, which may change over time, so that the links become broken. I will try to keep them current here.

## The footnotes
These are listed below under headings numbered by chapter and footnote number.

#### 1.6. 
You'll find my PhD thesis here: [Graph-based Cellular Automaton Models of Urban Spatial Processes](https://southosullivan.com/phd/). Chapter 2 is the slightly embarrassing take on space, mentioned in the note.

#### 1.8. 
Slides from the course I developed at Berkeley and taught from 2014 to 2018 [_Geog 80 Digital Worlds: An Introduction to Geospatial Technologies_](https://southosullivan.com/geog80/)</li>

#### 2.1. 
As marketing copy, this one is always already out of date. As of September 2023, the most direct reference to location on the Esri website is to be found here: [esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/spatial-analytics-data-science/overview](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/spatial-analytics-data-science/overview). 

#### 2.7. 
_ScapeToad_ is still at [http://scapetoad.choros.place/](http://scapetoad.choros.place/) (yes... it's `http`, not `https`).

#### 2.8.
The TopoJSON format specification is at [github.com/topojson/topojson-specification](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification).

#### 2.9.
The GeoJSON format specification is at [datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)

#### 2.10. 
You can experiment with the GeoJSON format at [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/).

#### 2.11. 
David Theobald's bewildered comment about the rendering speed of shapefiles is in an article in _ArcUser_ entitled 'Understanding topology and shapefiles': [esri.com/news/arcuser/0401/topo.html](https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0401/topo.html).

#### 2.14.
The PostGIS project home page: [osgeo.org/projects/postgis/](https://www.osgeo.org/projects/postgis/)

#### 3.3. 
The Degree Confluence Project is at [confluence.org](https://confluence.org/).

#### 3.5.
Find out more about 'Null Island' (i.e., 0&deg;N 0&deg;E) at its [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island).

#### 3.6.
The original announcement of geohash is in this blogpost by Greg Niemeyer: [blog.labix.org/2008/02/26/geohashorg-is-public](https://blog.labix.org/2008/02/26/geohashorg-is-public). You can generate geohash codes at the website [http://geohash.org](http://geohash.org) (yes `http` not `https`).

#### 3.7. 
Google's S2 index is explained at [s2geometry.io](https://s2geometry.io/).

#### 3.8. 
Uber's H3 index is described at [h3geo.org](https://h3geo.org/).
